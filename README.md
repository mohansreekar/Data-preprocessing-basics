# Data-preprocessing-basics
Performing crisp mlq steps and building a classification model
in this I have used a dataset glass which contains all the components of which the glass is made up of and the type it has been given, my  task was to perform all the preprocessing techniques on it like filling missing values, identifying and taking care of outliers, type casting, removal of duplicate values,feature selection and conversion into categorical. After finishing the preprocessing steps I have applied K-Neighbours Classifier to train the model.
